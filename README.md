# eollie.com: Ollie's React Personal Portfolio - ver 1.0

## Description
Welcome to my personal portfolio website! I used React to build this dynamic platform that reflects my leadership style, diverse skills, recent art projects, experiences, and parts of my journey.

I started with an existing template to learn and understand React better. Deciphering and understanding the code of others offers a great way to learn. This project helped me immensely in doing just that.

On top of that, the project offered a platform to exhibit my creativity. It had been a long time since I had collected and showcased my work from the past decade. This website served as an ideal moment to gather all of my creations and highlight what I've been up to.

I didn't just stop learning. I took the initial template, dived deep into the code, and made significant changes. I added custom features and my unique personal touch, which transformed it entirely. Now, this website stands not just as a portfolio but also as a testament to my learning journey and my ability to innovate and adapt.

## Acknowledgements
Embarking on this journey of learning and creating my portfolio has been an enriching experience. This project would not have been possible without the endless resources available online and the supportive coding community that always encourages learning and growth.

The initial template provided an excellent springboard to understand React.js better. By delving deep into the code and enhancing it with my unique touch, I've not only developed a greater appreciation for React.js but also understood the value of adapting existing resources to one's needs.

Going forward, I plan to continually improve this portfolio. I am particularly interested in exploring Tailwind CSS and Next.js, both of which I believe can bring even more powerful features to my portfolio. My journey in web development and design is far from over. This project is just a stepping stone towards a path of lifelong learning and evolving.

Lastly, I'd like to express my gratitude to everyone who's been a part of my journey so far. Whether it's through providing feedback, sharing valuable resources, or offering words of encouragement, your support has been instrumental in bringing this project to life. Here's to many more to come!
